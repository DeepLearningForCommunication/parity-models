# Experiments
There are two primary components in repository: code for training parity
models, and code for deploying parity models in a distributed system. We
refer to documentation in each of these components to illustrate how scripts
for running experiments can be executed:

1. [Training experiments](train/EXPERIMENTS.md) (Section 5 of the paper)
2. [Latency experiments](clipper-parm/README.md) (Section 6 of the paper)

We note that there are additional results described in Section 3 of the paper
based on an (unpublished) technical report. The code used for obtaining these
results may be found [here](https://github.com/Thesys-lab/learned-cc.git).
